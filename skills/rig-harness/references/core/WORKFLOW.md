# Repository Workflow

Repository product behavior, architecture, decisions, plans, code, tests, and
runtime signals are the system of record.

## Repository Map

- `AGENTS.md`: entry map and authority boundary.
- `README.md`, `docs/product/`, architecture, and decisions: current intent and
  constraints.
- `docs/plans/`: durable work; `docs/templates/`: optional structures.
- Code, tests, CI, and runtime signals: executable and observable truth.

## Select The Work Shape

### Does The Work Need Durable Memory?

Use an ephemeral plan for bounded work. Create one plan in
`docs/plans/active/` when work spans sessions, coordinates contributors, has
meaningful dependencies, needs recovery, or cannot safely resume from its diff.

Use `docs/templates/exec-plan.md`. Keep progress and task-local decisions in the
same file; avoid parallel task records without an independent audience.

### Does The Work Need Human Judgment?

Before editing, identify authority for new externally observable policy. If
materially different choices remain, stop and request the smallest decision.
Configurable defaults are not authority.

For example, `Add rate limiting` without a quota, trusted key, enforcement
topology, or response contract must stop. `Enforce the documented 20 requests
per minute per authenticated tenant` may proceed.

Also pause for ambiguous product intent, difficult recovery, weakened
validation, security, or compatibility, and insufficient authority.

### What Proves The Behavior?

Use focused tests for local rules, integration tests for boundaries, end-to-end
interaction for user-visible behavior, recovery rehearsal for dangerous
operations, and measurements for reliability or performance.

Plans, checklists, and completion messages do not prove product behavior by
themselves.

### Does The Work Encode An Invariant?

For architecture, reliability, security, or quality boundaries:

1. Find an accepted repository authority that states the required boundary.
   Conventions, code patterns, tests, defaults, and undocumented preferences do
   not establish policy. Stop when authority is absent or materially ambiguous.
2. Reuse the repository's native validation owner and command. Add the smallest
   mechanical check that covers the accepted scope and emits a diagnostic naming
   the violation, rule, and next action.
3. Require positive proof that allowed behavior passes and negative proof that
   the targeted forbidden behavior fails for the intended reason.
4. Report enforcement precisely: a local command is available or passed; a hook
   is optional developer convenience; CI either invokes the check or does not;
   branch protection is externally configured or unverified. Source or CI
   presence alone does not prove merge blocking.

Do not install hooks or change CI, merge, or branch-protection settings unless
separately authorized. Use the [invariant encoding pattern](patterns/encoding-invariants.md)
for the complete method.

## Task Flows

### Read-Only Request

Read only what the answer, review, diagnosis, plan, or status needs. Use
read-only inspection; do not edit files or Harness state. Discovery never
grants authority to fix what it finds.

### Bounded Change

Restate the outcome, inspect its authority, implementation, patterns, and proof,
make the smallest coherent change, run focused and required checks, and report
the outcome, changes, evidence, and limits.

No parallel lifecycle record is required.

### Durable Planned Change

Create or resume one active plan. Keep outcome, context, approach, risk,
recovery, progress, decisions, and validation current. Implement in verifiable
groups, promote lasting decisions, run focused and repository proof, then record
the result and move the plan to `docs/plans/completed/`.

### Operate The Application

When a task requires the real application:

1. Find the consumer-owned runbook and verify prerequisites and ownership.
2. Start only an isolated instance, prove readiness, and create known state.
3. Reproduce through the real interface and inspect correlated runtime evidence.
4. Validate through that interface, then stop only resources this run owns.

If no verified runbook exists, inspect current repository authority and report
or propose the missing guidance. Do not invent commands, credentials, product
policy, or cleanup obligations. The application-runbook template supplies
proposal structure, not proof that the application is operable.

### Improve The Harness

During ordinary work, report reusable agent friction without changing the
Harness for that new purpose. When the user explicitly invokes
`$improve-harness`, use `docs/templates/harness-improvement.md` to:

1. preserve the observed baseline and human intervention;
2. locate the earliest missing context, capability, owner, authority, proof, or
   environment boundary;
3. make the smallest authorized change at that owner;
4. run native proof and require a materially equivalent fresh-agent rerun; and
5. decide to keep, revise, or remove the intervention.

Do not claim improvement when the rerun did not retrieve or exercise the
intervention. Keep the record active while fresh-rerun evidence is pending.

## Completion Standard

A change is complete when the outcome exists or its blocker is explicit,
repository truth remains current, behavior-appropriate proof passed or its gap
is disclosed, any required plan is current, and the report separates facts,
limits, and unattempted work. Descriptions do not replace observed proof.
